Assignment 5.1 for ML/AI class
Some of my conclusions (hypothesis) regarding the bar coupon (these are also posted as comments in the junyper notebook):
#Temperature (weather) was a factor in general acceptance of all coupons
#The bar coupon had a lower overall accpetance rate than some of the other coupon types, such as carry out & take away or the inexpensive restaurants
#In comparison with the overall bar coupon acceptance rate of 41%, it was noted:
#Bar coupon had low acceptance when kids were passengers
#People who went to bars more than 1 time per month and were under 30 were likely to accept
#People who went to bars more than 1 time per month and were over 25 were likely to accept
#So I would conclude, 25-30 years of age and go to bars more than 1 time per month likely to accept
#All ages people went to bars 3 or more times most likely to accept 
#People below age 25 and go to bars less than 1 time did were not as likely to accept 

Summary of conclusions for CarryAway (these are also posted as comments in the junyper notebook):
#Overall accpetance is high at over 73.7%
#People who get carryout more than 4 times per month had slightly higher accpetance rate of 75.3%
#People with incomes under $50K were more likely to accept by 5% margin 
#Interesting that travel in the same direction was not favorable for accepting coupon
#People who were going home or had no urgent place to go were more likely to accept than those going to work
#People without bachelors degrees or higher accepted more than those with such degrees
